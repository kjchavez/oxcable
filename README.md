OxilaryCable
=============

A simple audio processing and MIDI framework in Rust.

This is a personal project of mine, with two goals:
 1. To learn Rust
 2. To learn

I am still fleshing out the core libraries, so interfaces are very unstable.

Installing
----------

Currently. OxilaryCable requires PortAudio be installed on your machine. On Mac,
this is available on Homebrew. To install, run:

    brew install portaudio

ClickTrack
----------

This project is a successor to another project of mine ClickTrack. ClickTrack is
an audio framework written in C++. Much of this project is a port of work
originally done in ClickTrack. To see more, visit 
[my ClickTrack repository](https://github.com/thenyeguy/ClickTrack).
